#   Fix a memory handling bug
#   osdn #46272

# Not in the upstream Freeciv server
# ----------------------------------
# meson_webperimental installs webperimental ruleset
# freeciv_segfauls_fix is a workaround some segfaults in the Freeciv server. Freeciv bug #23884.
# message_escape is a patch for protecting against script injection in the message texts.
# tutorial_ruleset changes the ruleset of the tutorial to one supported by Freeciv-web.
#      - This should be replaced by modification of the tutorial scenario that allows it to
#        work with multiple rulesets (Requires patch #7362 / SVN r33159)
# win_chance includes 'Chance to win' in Freeciv-web map tile popup.
# webgl_vision_cheat_temporary is a temporary solution to reveal terrain types to the WebGL client.
# longturn implements a very basic longturn mode for Freeciv-web.
# load_command_confirmation adds a log message which confirms that loading is complete, so that Freeciv-web can issue additional commands.
# endgame-mapimg is used to generate a mapimg at endgame for hall of fame.

# Local patches
# -------------
# Finally patches from patches/local are applied. These can be used
# to easily apply a temporary debug change that's not meant ever to get
# included to the repository.
